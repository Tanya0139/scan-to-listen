# 📖🔊 Scan-to-Listen: Bridging Physical to Digital Audio with Generative AI

Welcome to **Scan-to-Listen**, an AI-powered feature prototype that brings printed words to life! Developed as an intelligent add-on concept for **KukuFM**, this tool allows users to scan book covers or posters and instantly discover related audiobooks or podcasts on the platform.

---

## 🎯 Objective & Direct Benefit

In today’s hybrid world of physical and digital media, **Scan-to-Listen** serves as a seamless bridge—helping users interact with real-world content through digital audio experiences.  
By scanning physical content (books, posters, public figures), users are provided with semantically relevant audio content from KukuFM.

### ✨ Highlights:
- 📱 Scan any book cover or poster in real life.
- 🤖 AI identifies keywords and context.
- 🎧 Instantly stream or save recommended audio.
- 📓 Save favorites in your personal "Kuku Diary".

---

## 🚀 Benefits to the User

- **Zero Hassle Discovery**: No more manual searches—just scan and listen.
- **Intelligent Matching**: AI suggestions tailored to the scanned input.
- **Kuku Diary**: Save audio content for future listening, promoting regular engagement.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- `pytesseract`: OCR to extract text from physical content.
- `Sentence-BERT`: For generating semantic embeddings.
- `Fuzzy Matching`: Handles OCR noise and enhances match accuracy.
- `Streamlit`: UI for fast prototyping and demo.
- `JSON/CSV`: Local simulated backend for content retrieval and diary management.

---

## 🧠 AI Techniques

- **Semantic Search**: Embeddings > keywords for better context matching.
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Error tolerance during OCR mismatches.
- **Similarity Scoring**: Ranks top audio matches by relevance.
